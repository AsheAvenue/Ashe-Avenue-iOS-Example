Annie Werner|50|Arts Evangelist, Tumblr|Annie Werner is the Arts Evangelist at Tumblr, where she works to cultivate the arts community on the platform both online and off. She studied in Gallatin at New York University, majoring in New Media and Public Discourse - which is essentially the perfect degree for what she does right now at Tumblr. She grew up in Texas where her favorite museum is the Menil Collection.

On the images she selected, she said, “I was most struck by images that emulated a certain mystery of life. Sometimes it's big, sometimes it's small; where are we going and where have we been... I felt a certain intrigue to these photos which is why I chose them.”
