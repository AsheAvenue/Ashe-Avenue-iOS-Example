Stephen Mayes|40|Director, VII Photo Agency|Stephen Mayes is the Director of VII Photo in New York and has worked at the top levels of photography for 25 years in the areas of journalism, art, commercial and fashion. He has served as Chair of the World Press Photo competition and has led the creative departments at Getty Images and Eyestorm.com.

When curating this collection from Offset, he said, “I was looking for images that spark curiosity, asking the questions ‘what’ and ‘why’.  The images that do this best have an extra ingredient, which is a point of view, where the artist says something personal about how they see the world.  The results say something about the artist, as well as the subject, which makes them rich narrative images.”
