Jon Oringer|50|Founder & CEO, Shutterstock|Jon Oringer founded Shutterstock in 2003 with thousands of his own digital photographs, disrupting the traditional stock image marketplace with a frictionless way to buy royalty free imagery. He’s a serial entrepreneur, a certified commercial helicopter pilot, and enjoys shooting film with his Mamiya 7II camera. An avid lover of the arts, Jon is most inspired by the dramatic landscapes and unique lifestyle imagery in the Offset collection. He’s also responsible for coming up with the name, as nod to high-end printing, and a symbol of something disruptive... Offset from the rest.
